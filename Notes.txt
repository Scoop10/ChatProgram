Need to implement the server to server communication:
- Server Side
    - Need to implement multiple server port and all the server to server communication (server_hello)
    - Implement receiving client_updates as part of this
    - Need to store each server address and it's respective clients
    - When a client_update comes through need to deal with this (new function)
        - Just need to update the sending servers clients in the server_list
    - Implement storing files
    - Implement message checking before forwarding (see if they follow the specified formats)
    - Clear up the who's online bit - should we be sending a periodic who's online message so that we are more up to date on who is actually online.
- Client Side
    - Implement sending a private message (encryption)
    - Implement receiving a private message (decryption)
    - Implement sending a file
    - Implement signatures




How Message Signatures Work
The process of creating and verifying message signatures involves several key steps:

Signing: The sender generates a hash (a fixed-size bit string) of the message, which is then encrypted with the sender’s private key to create the signature.
Transmission: The original message and its signature are sent to the recipient.
Verification: Upon receiving, the recipient decrypts the signature using the sender’s public key to retrieve the hash value. 
The recipient then hashes the received message and compares this hash to the decrypted hash. If they match, it confirms the message integrity and sender authenticity.
