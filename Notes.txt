Need to implement the server to server communication:
- Server Side
    - Need to implement multiple server port and all the server to server communication (server_hello)
    - Implement receiving client_updates as part of this
    - Need to store each server address and it's respective clients
    - When a client_update comes through need to deal with this (new function)
        - Just need to update the sending servers clients in the server_list
    - Implement storing files
    - Implement message checking before forwarding (see if they follow the specified formats)
    - Clear up the who's online bit - should we be sending a periodic who's online message so that we are more up to date on who is actually online.
- Client Side
    - Implement sending a file
    - Implement signatures
    - Implement client names for more user friendly stuff
